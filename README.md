You're all set, start coding 👩‍💻👨‍💻 !

Remove everything in the src/styles/ folder, src/index.html and src/index.scss/ if you'd like to start 100% fresh and/or create your own Sass worklow. I based my folder structure off the 7-1 pattern.

npm run build when you're ready to upload your site to your FTP / hosting platform of choice. This will create a dist folder with all your website assets optimized and compressed.
